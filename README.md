## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Karthika]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Karthika C] - [NSS College Of Engineering]

### Project Description
[The **Chaya Kada Chronicles** is a whimsical web app that logs friends‚Äô chai breaks with quirky ‚ÄúChai Vibes,‚Äù absurd stats, and a goofy leaderboard, while picking snacks by budget with playful personalities.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Counting no of tea breaks is ridiculous]

[Helps to keep track of the no of tea breaks and to choose the snack!]
